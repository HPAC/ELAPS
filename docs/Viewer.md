ELAPS:Viewer
============

The ELAPS:Viewer allows to analyze and visualize reports generated by ELAPS:Mat.
It can load a set of reports and presents different computed performance metrics
in table or plot form.  Each report can be treated either as a single experiment
or call by call to showcase which calls contribute how much to the resulting
performance.  


Metrics
-------
Each experiment can be analyzed with respect to a set of different metrics,
ranging from raw cycle counts to composed Gflops/s and efficiencies.  Additional
metrics can be added as python scrips in `metrics/`


Statistics
----------
Each individual experiment resulting in a data point is repeated several times.
By default the median performance values of these repetitions is presented.
However, ELAPS:Viewer provides a larger range of statistical quantities that can
be analyzed and separately plotted.


Exporting plots and data
------------------------
ELAPS:Viewer can export each of its plots (thanks to matplotlib) as well as the
raw data presented in such a plot.  The raw data is exported in a space
separated text file, which can e.g. directly be loaded into gnuplot.
