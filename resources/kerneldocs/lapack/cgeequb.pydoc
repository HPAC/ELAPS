(('cgeequb', "CGEEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an\nM-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row\nscale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make\nthe largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with\nelements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have an absolute value of at most\nthe radix.\n\nR(i) and C(j) are restricted to be a power of the radix between\nSMLNUM = smallest safe number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.
