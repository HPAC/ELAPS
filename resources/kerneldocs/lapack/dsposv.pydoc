(('dsposv', "DSPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations\n   A * X = B,\nwhere A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B\nare N-by-NRHS matrices.\n\nDSPOSV first attempts to factorize the matrix in SINGLE PRECISION\nand use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure\nto produce a solution with DOUBLE PRECISION normwise backward error\nquality (see below). If the approach fails the method switches to a\nDOUBLE PRECISION factorization and solve.\n\nThe iterative refinement is not going to be a winning strategy if\nthe ratio SINGLE PRECISION performance over DOUBLE PRECISION\nperformance is too small.
